# Bagchaal Game

Bagchaal is a traditional board game played in Nepal. This project is a digital implementation of the Bagchaal game using C++ and the SDL library. It allows users to play against the computer or against another player.

## Features

- Play against the computer: Users can choose to play against the computer as a single player(under development phase).
- Two-player mode: Users can play against another player on the same device.
- Interactive UI: The game provides a user-friendly interface with graphical representations of the board and game pieces using SDL.
- Game rules: The project includes the rules of Bagchaal to help users understand the gameplay.
- Turn-based gameplay: The game follows the turn-based gameplay of Bagchaal, allowing each player to make moves alternately.
- Win condition: The game detects and declares a winner when a player successfully captures all of their opponent's game pieces.

## Motivation behind developing it
- Cultural preservation: This type of Baghchal has been a long lived game in our society and represents, preserves and promotes       a long lived cultural heritage.
- Entertainment and recreation: Baghchal provides enjoyable leisure and friendly competition.
- Educational value: Baghchal teaches strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Community building: Baghchal fosters a sense of community and social interaction.
- Economic opportunities: Baghchal can stimulate attract foreigners and help generate revenue through gaming tourism.
- Personal fulfillment and creativity:It has been an integral parts of my childhood and developing Baghchal allows for expression of creativity and passion for gaming.

## Learnings
-    Mastering SDL basics: Setting up the environment, handling events, and managing the game loop.
