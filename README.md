- Interactive UI: The game provides a user-friendly interface with graphical representations of the board and game pieces using SDL.
- Game rules: The project includes the rules of Bagchaal to help users understand the gameplay.
- Turn-based gameplay: The game follows the turn-based gameplay of Bagchaal, allowing each player to make moves alternately.
- Win condition: The game detects and declares a winner when a player successfully captures all of their opponent's game pieces.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++
- Game Library: SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) along with it's image and music handling packages
